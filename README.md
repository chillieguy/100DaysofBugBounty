In this repository, I will share details about my #100DaysofBugBounty Challenge. This initiative is designed to maintain a continuous learning mindset, pushing me to acquire new knowledge every day and build a habit. Daily topics will include learning materials, research and bug hunting attempts.

##  Commitment

**Commitment:** *I will spend 30 minutes or more a day either learning or practicing what I have learned.*
